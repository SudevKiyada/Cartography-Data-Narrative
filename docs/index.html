These statistics are from phase 1 of 2022 UP Elections. We don’t even know what the state of other states is.<br><br> However, that India has had seen well educated and erudite political leaders who created a unique and resilient set of democratic institutions that have strengthened over time. And yet, more recent endorsements have yielded a large number of poorly educated candidates; that includes an uneducated Chief Minister, an uneducated dacoit MP and even MPs and MLAs who couldn’t even read their respective oaths.<br><br> All this was supposed to change after the advent of a political party started by an IITian. There have been a lot of debates on how educated political candidates can bring a change in the Indian politics. It has been almost 10 years, since this IITian came into picture as a politician, and they have been ruling in the national capital of India and in some of the state elections they are faring slightly better than one of the ‘dynastic’ party of our country.<br><br> In India, you need to be at least a 10th pass to even apply for a peon's job in the government. Curiously enough, there's no such educational stipulation to become a Mantri. So, we want to put a data backed narrative on how our wannabe Mantri’s are exploiting this lack of qualification to rise up the rungs of Indian Politics.</p> </section> <section class="actual_width"> <p class="subtitle">What India thinks?</p> <p class="info">We conducted a survey about the perception of citizens toward the educational qualifications of Members of Parliament in Power.

What we further do is divide the 10 Educational Levels in just two levels. Elementary Educated : Till 12th Pass Highly Educated : Graduate and Above Because a Grduation degree plays a pivotal role in persons life and empowers him in a lot many ways, so it was chosen as the pivot. We plotted percentage of Highly Educated Candidates on the Map of India with a diverging color scale. Red shows more number of Elementary Educated Candidates, White Shows the mid point; equal number of both and Green shows a higher number of Highly Educated Candidates.<br><br> This is how the map looks...Hover over the maps to see what Indian Citizens choose. </p> </section>  <a id="home"> <img class="image_on img-center" style="width:80%" src="2009all.d519d743.png" alt="logo"> <img class="image_off img-center" style="width:80%" src="2009win.cc67377c.png" alt="logo"> </a> <a id="home"> <img class="image_on img-center" style="width:80%" src="2014all.b181a717.png" alt="logo"> <img class="image_off img-center" style="width:80%" src="2014win.9b50aad5.png" alt="logo"> </a> <a id="home"> <img class="image_on img-center" style="width:80%" src="2019all.92b761ac.png" alt="logo"> <img class="image_off img-center" style="width:80%" src="2019win.ae328de2.png" alt="logo"> </a> <section class="actual_width"> <p class="subtitle">Conclusion</p> <p class="info">It is pretty clear from the above Chloropleths that most of the States are offered an almost equal mix of Highly Educated and Elementary Educated candidates but once they pass the test of Public, the mix has a higher number of Highly Educated Ones.<br><br> Illustrating the same using a buble chart. </p> </section> <div style="width:60%;background-color:#fff;border-radius:12px;margin:0 auto;padding:24px"> <iframe width="100%" height="923" frameborder="0" src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@sudev/education-and-politicians?cells=chartTickets%2CchartWinners"></iframe> </div> <p class="key_quote subtitle">"Remember: things can be bad, and getting better."<br> ~ Hans Rosling</p> <p class="info key_quote">P.S. : Just 4 of those 140 8th Pass Candidates ultimately won the elections.</p> </body></html>
